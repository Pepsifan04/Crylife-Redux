# Crylife-Redux
The goal of this god-forsaken project is to _imporve_ and _descope_ the original **Crylife** and *Crylife v2*
providing nice, clean, small mod that can be enjoyed without constant problems janky mechanics

Rewritten from scratch to avoid scope creep and patchy solutions that work 50% of time or require constant in-game checks to see if everything is in place
