# CRYLife Redux

## Summary
Main goal is to improve the gameplay flow of the mod.
Descope the original idea, restore Half-Life 2 theme to the mod while adding Crysis inspired features.

Secondary goal is to simplify the underlaying code by removing implemented but unused features, reimplementing existing usable features in a structured manner, making the mod less prone to softlocks and other jank.


## TO DO LIST OF THINGS TO DO TOO
[] Use common.lua for basic gameplay functions
[] Reimplement basic movement with state monitoring
[] Reimplement NHEV modes
[] Change NHEV model back to HEV
[] Figure out what guns to keep
[] Reimplement weapon mod system
[] Figure out where give weapons to player
[] Where (if at all) give weapon mods to player
[] Add new events and enemies to existing HL2 campaign
[] Many more that I can't think of
