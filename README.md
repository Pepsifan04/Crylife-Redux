# CRYLife Redux

## Summary
Main goal is to improve the gameplay flow of the mod.
Descope the original idea, restore Half-Life 2 theme to the mod while adding Crysis inspired features.

Secondary goal is to simplify the underlaying code by removing implemented but unused features, reimplementing existing usable features in a structured manner, making the mod less prone to softlocks and other jank.


## TO DO LIST OF THINGS TO DO TOO
- [ ] Use common.lua for basic gameplay functions
- [ ] Reimplement basic movement with state monitoring
- [ ] Reimplement NHEV modes
- [ ] Change NHEV model back to HEV
- [x] Figure out what guns to keep
- [ ] Reimplement weapon mod system
- [ ] Figure out where give weapons to player
- [ ] Where (if at all) give weapon mods to player
- [ ] Add new events and enemies to existing HL2 campaign
- [ ] Many more that I can't think of 


Guns that'll stay:
Gravity Gun (keeping)
9mm Pistol (fallback weapon, keeping)
Revolver (replaces Desert Eagle, serving as a rare and powerful handgun)
AK47 (keeping due to its thematic fit with the Eastern European setting)
PP-19 Bizon or VZ. 61 Skorpion (replacing MP7 for an Eastern European-style SMG)
Pump Action Shotgun (keeping)
Bolt Action Sniper Rifle (keeping)
RPG (keeping for story progression)
Bow (keeping, unique and offers variety)
